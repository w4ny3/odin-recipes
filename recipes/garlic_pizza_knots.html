    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I've made these for Big Game events, regular game events, I'm bored let's make something events; you name it. You will be disappointed you did not double this recipe.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb. pizza dough</li>
        <li>0.50 cups unsalted butter</li>
        <li>4 large garlic cloves</li>
        <li>1 tsp Italian Seasoning</li>
        <li>0.25 cup fresh parsley, chopped</li>
        <li>Finely grained Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Marinara sauce for dipping</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>On a lightly floured surface roll out the pizza dough into around a 12-inch square.</li>
        <li>Cut the dough into 1-inch thick strips using a pizza cutter or knife. Tie each strip into a loose knot.</li>
        <li>Place the knots in a 10-12 inch cast iron pan sprayed with cooking oil. Cover the pan with plastic wrap and let the knots rise in a warm spot for 60 to 90 minutes until puffy.</li>
        <li>During this time you can preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C)</li>
        <li>Bake for 25 to 30 minutes until the knots are a golden brown.</li>
        <li>While the knots are baking, melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Add the minced garlic and cook until fragrant, about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from  heat and stir in the Italian seasoning and chopped parsley.</li>
        <li>Toss and serve. When the knots are out of the oven, immediately brush hot garlic butter onto top to coat. Serve the garlic knots while warm, sprinkled with Parmesan cheese and with a side of marinara for dipping. </li>
    </ol>
